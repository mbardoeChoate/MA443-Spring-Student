## Redlining

Redlining is the practice of determining the values of homes and the risk associated with home loans primarily on the racial and ethnic character of a neighborhood. It specifically refers to maps that were made in the 1930's that mapped neighborhoods of cities across the country, and described them in terms of the housing stock and the racial and ethnic make up of the neighborhoods. At that time, the  Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) mapped neighborhoods that fell in to 1 of 4 classifications (A-Best, B-Still Desirable, C-Definitely Declining, D-Hazardous). The areas that were classified as D were colored red on the maps, and thus the term redlining. The D areas were areas that often had large Black populations or other populations that were discriminated against at the time such as immigrants and Jews.

## Redlining 2: New Haven and Baltimore

Using computer programming I was able to do a more consistent data generation and in more areas. I was able to download all the houses for sale in New Haven and Baltimore, then use the addresses and a Google Sheets Add-on to generate a longitude and latitude for each house. Then using that information I was able to write a computer program that determined if a house was in one of the HOLC regions, then copy the information from the website that we looked at previously.

Because there have not been enough houses for sale in New Haven to give a reasonable sample of all the regions, I have included homes from Baltimore where similar data is available.

### Goals

The question we are trying to answer is what effect can we see on home values today in the areas that were previously listed in some HOLC section of New Haven and Baltimore.

*Make a guess about what you think we will see about the relationship between housing prices in different areas of the HOLC map?*



### First Pass on the data

The data is a list of homes for sale in the New Haven and Baltimore regions at the end of February 2021. Homes that were not in one of the HOLC maps from New Haven or Baltimore have been excluded from the dataset. The dataset is named ```Combined.csv```. Load the data and get a sense of the variables that it contains.

Load the data:

```{r}


```
Let's look at how the current price in different in different HOLC zones.

```{r}

```

*What do you notice about the relationship between Price and HOLC_Rating?*



#### Sample Size

One question we should deal with before we get to far along is that of sample size. The HOLC did not divide the city up equally among the different ratings. It tended to have very few homes in the A range. *Do a calculation that shows how many homes there are in each rating group. Then comment on the difference.*


```{r}

```

Now let's look at the difference in average home value of by each of the ratings, and compute the standard deviation of those prices as well. *Do that below.*

```{r}

```


While there is a big difference in the variation from A to the other ratings. Let's look at the results of ANOVA test here. **This a bad move generally as we will see soon.**

```{r}

```

Investigate the plots:

```{r}

```
The graphs don't look too good. 

Look at the individual impacts using the TukeyHSD.

```{r}

```

*Describe the meaning of the TukeyHSD results.*

### Controling the Particulars

One issue with the analysis above is that we have a lot of variation in the kinds of homes that are in each area. It much more likely true that the value of the home is dependent on factors like size and whether they are in New Haven or Baltimore, as well as possibly the HOLC_Rating. Let's try to control for those other variables and then look for the effect of the HOLC_Rating.

*Create a linear model that best fits the data using variables: Living.Area, Bathrooms, Bedrooms, and State.*

```{r}

```

Now that we have our price model, we can take the residuals. These are the parts of the price that are not explained by the particulars of the house, and maybe part of what is left is the effect of the HOLC_Rating. 

```{r}


```

Now let's look at how the residuals might be explained by the HOLC rating.

```{r}

```
*Discuss what this graph indicates about the effect of the HOLC_Rating on prices.*

Now calculate an ANOVA on the residuals to see if a difference in prices can be found once we control for the houses particulars.
```{r}

```



```{r}

```

Notice that our plots for the ANOVA, while still not good, are better than they were before. Let's do an TukeyHSD to see where the differences are. 

```{r}


```



*Describe the meaning of this data about how current prices are different for different HOLC_ratings.*

As people have rediscovered the details of the redlining practice in recent years, there has been a lot of public focus on these differences. But a lot has happened from 1937 when these spaces were defined. But trends like gentrification and other issues have created a much more muddled view of things.
