1. A garden center wants to store leftover packets of vegetable seeds for sale the following spring, but the center is concerned that the seeds may not germinate at the same rate a year later. The manager finds a packet of last yearâ€™s green bean seeds and plants them as a test. Although the packet claims a germination rate of 92%, only 171 of 200 test seeds sprout. Is this evidence that the seeds have lost viability during a year in storage? Test an appropriate hypothesis and state your conclusion. 

a) Write appropriate hypotheses.

b) What is a type I error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

c) What is a type II error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

d) Which is worse in this context?

e) Based on your answer to part d) is it better to use an alpha level of .1 or .001.

f) Perform the test and find the p-value using the alpha you selected in part e.

g) Make a graph

h) State your conclusion.

i) Do you think this difference is meaningful? Explain.


2. Data on a random sample of 100 births for babies in North Carolina can be found in ```../../data/births.csv```. Government officials are wondering if their messaging has convinced mothers to smoke less. The goal was to to get under 40% of pregnant women to smoke. Did they succeed?

a) Write appropriate hypotheses.

b) What is a type I error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

c) What is a type II error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

d) Which is worse in this context?

e) Based on your answer to part d) is it better to use an alpha level of .1 or .01.

f) Perform the test and find the p-value using the alpha you selected in part e.

g) Make a graph

h) State your conclusion.




3. Census data for a certain county show that 19% of the adult residents are Hispanic. Suppose 72 people are called for jury duty and only 9 of them are Hispanic. Does this apparent underrepresentation of Hispanics call into question the fairness of the jury selection system? 

a) Write appropriate hypotheses.

b) What is a type I error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

c) What is a type II error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

d) Which is worse in this context?

e) Based on your answer to part d) is it better to use an alpha level of .1 or .01.

f) Perform the test and find the p-value using the alpha you selected in part e.

g) Make a graph

h) State your conclusion.




4. A simple random sample of US adults in March 2013 were asked if they would vote for or against a law that would reduce US and Russian nuclear arsenals. The results are in the file ```../../data/nuclear_survey.csv``` Prior to the poll it was believed that 60% of Americans were for disarmament. Have things changed?

a) Write appropriate hypotheses.

b) What is a type I error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

c) What is a type II error in this context? Explain the ramifications of that error.

d) Which is worse in this context?

e) Based on your answer to part d) is it better to use an alpha level of .05 or .01.

f) Perform the test and find the p-value using the alpha you selected in part e.

g) Make a graph

h) State your conclusion.
